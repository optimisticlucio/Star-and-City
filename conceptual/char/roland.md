# Roland 
### A Grade 9 Fixer


---
## General Playstyle

Roland will be the basic pick up character with no real fancy mechanics. Probably a Shoto. He will have his endgame weapons, but try not to spoil too much.

His weapons, in no order, are:

- Normal ass baton, used for most of the game.

- Two large pistols.

- A long range hammer.

- An extremely fast katana (usually followed by a flurry of swipes).

- Claws.

- Two daggers.

- A mace and a hammer.

- A comically large greatsword.

- Two swords that are used simultaneously (yes he has many swords).

- Shotgun.

- Duranal, his own large sword.

## Basic Attacks (and general use)

- 5R: Roland punches with the baton-less bat.

- 5W: Roland swings with his baton. Decent range but nothing spectacular.

- 5B: Roland swings his mace forward, hitting far but hitting somewhat slow.

- 5P: Roland quickly unsheathes the katana, dealing two swipes slightly off the ground. On block this leaves him minus, but is a frame trap and very fast.

## Special Moves

### Allas Workshop

Slow moving projectile, represented by an extremely fast spinning sword. As most shotos, the projectile primarily is used as a defensive/pressure tool by pushing an opponent back on impact, being long range, and forcing the opponent to deal with it by jumping and limiting their options.

### Duranal

Invincible reversal move. Roland swings his sword over him, dealing significant damage on hit, and leaving him wide open on miss/block. (*I don't think he should jump? A lot of games just assume the reversal involves jumping because of Ryu. -L*)

### Crystal Atelier

Approach tool to close distance and keep up pressure. We're not sure how this works yet because we have no reference for what kind of pressure will be problematic. *TODO!*

## Supers

### Furioso

Single-hit cinematic super. Just watch [the furioso attack](https://youtu.be/lTc7yhWfY1U) and take notes tbh.


## Unique Mechanics

None. He's the introductory character.
