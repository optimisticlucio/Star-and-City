# Overview

**Game Pace:** Relatively Slow for an Anime Fighter, but not actually slow. Street Fighter 3~ esque.

**Timer:** Is a consideration. Not necessarily active, but not ignoreable.


## Design Principles

- Avoid mixup-oriented characters if possible.
- No characters who require combos to be functional.
- "Fuck it we ball" moves are entertaining, try to include at least one per character, even if just a button!
- Try to give characters multiple ways of approaching a problem. Make sure we don't make Happy Chaos.


## Individual Mechanics

**Airdashing:** No.

**Fastfall:** Maybe? Try.

**Motion/Simple Inputs:** Keep motion inputs, but tend towards simpler inputs.
