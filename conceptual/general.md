# Overview

**Game Pace:** Relatively Slow for an Anime Fighter, but not actually slow. Street Fighter 3~ esque.

**Timer:** Is a consideration. Not necessarily active, but not ignoreable.

**Corner:** Wall-break mechanic like Strive, except no wall splat - the person just instantly flies through the wall when they would be splatted. Figure out what benefit that gives later.

**Attacks:** 4 attacks - Red, White, Black, Pale. (*This could be too abstract and make understanding the game difficult for people learning it. We could use Ruina's blunt/slash/pierce but that limits us to 3 attacks. -L*) Generally speaking:
- Red will be simple and light/fast.
- White will be decent midrange options.
- Black will be the heavy attacks.
- Pale will be ???

## Design Principles

- Avoid mixup-oriented characters if possible.
- No characters who require combos to be functional.
- "Fuck it we ball" moves are entertaining, try to include at least one per character, even if just a button!
- Try to give characters multiple ways of approaching a problem. Make sure we don't make Happy Chaos in terms of tools for everything.
- Try giving movement options unique properties (like a dash hop, teleport, counter, projectile dodge walk)


## Individual Mechanics

**Airdashing:** No.

**Fastfall:** Maybe? Try.

**Motion/Simple Inputs:** Keep motion inputs, but tend towards simpler inputs.

**Super bar:** One straight super bar, try to keep mechanics revolving around that and not involve more bars. TRY - start match with super bar partially full.

**Double KOs:** If both people knock eachother out on the last round, *it keeps going until someone wins.*

**Pushblock:** No.

## Unique Mechanic - EGO GIFTS

Primarily - the idea is to implement a roguelike-esque mechanic into the fight, where players could pick a "buff" to assist them in the rest of the round/match. **(SEE [EGO_GIFT](./ego_gifts.md) FOR MORE INFO AND EXAMPLES)**
