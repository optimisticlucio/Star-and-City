# OVERVIEW

The EGO Gifts mechanic is that players get to pick a buff once every while in a match, currently **at the start of every round past the first. (From third round onwards, every other round.)** These buffs would minorly change how the game is played, but introduce vareity into the matches. 

## NOTES
- Something very important to watch out is that there is no EGO gift which is an auto-pick against a certain character, or one that is busted period. Side-grade them to hell and back if that ever happens.


## EXAMPLES

- **All-Around Cleaner:** Grants airdashing.
- **Heart of Aspiration:** Adds heartbeat. If you input a command within 5~ frames of the heart beat, increases damage.
- **Price of Silence:** Round Timer is now (shorter than usual).
- **Whitenight:** Gives single use super move with large hitbox.
- **Red Shoes:** Doubles/1.5x's walking speed.
- **Fairy Gentleman:** On default grab (not command grabs), restores health.
- **The Road Home:** Increases stage size, but pushing someone into the wall/off the stage wins the match. If both people pick it, the stage is comically small.
- **Blubbering Toad:** On hit, take away some of the opponent's meter.
- **Punishing Bird:** Counters deal more damage and give a little bit more stun.
