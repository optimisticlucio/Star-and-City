# OVERVIEW

The EGO Gifts mechanic is that players get to pick a buff once every while in a match, currently **at the start of every odd-numbered round** (first, third, fifth, seventh, etc.) These buffs would minorly change how the game is played, but introduces vareity into the matches. 

## NOTES
- Something very important to watch out is that there is no EGO gift which is an auto-pick against a certain character, or one that is busted period. Side-grade them to hell and back if that ever happens.
- KEEP MATCH DESCRIPTIONS SHORT. >8 words if possible.

## EXAMPLES

- **Illusory Hunt:** Enables airdashing.
  - Based on `All-Around Cleaner`.
  - Pretty straightforward: enables dashing in the air for a character.
- **Fervent Beats:** Increases damage when timed to the heartbeat.
  - Based on `Heart of Aspiration`.
  - Adds a heartbeat. If you input a command within ~5 frames of the heart beat, increases damage.
- **The Thirteenth Toll:** Reduce timer by 30 seconds.
  - Based on `The Price of Silence`.
  - Reduces the time of the round by 30 seconds. *This does stack.* (**NOTE:** Not married to 30 seconds necessarily.)
- **Divine Power:** Gain a single-use, powerful super.
  - Based on `White Night`.
  - Uses a bonkers super, maybe at the cost of the whole super bar. (**NOTE:** This one need more fine-tuning.)
- **Obsession:** [Double/1.5x] walking speed.
  - Based on `Red Shoes`.
  - Increases walking speed.
- **Green Spirit:** On default grab, restore health.
  - Based on `Fairy Gentlemen`.
  - When dealing damage with a default grab (not a command grab), it restores some % of health, maybe proportional to damage dealt.
- **Melty Eyeball:** On hit, steal some of the opponent's meter.
  - Based on `Blubbering Toad`.
  - Takes a tiny slice of the opponent's meter upon hitting them.
- **Punishment:** Counters deal more damage and stun slightly longer.
  - Based on `Punishing Bird`.
  - Self-explanatory. Probably just a few more frames of stun and a bit more damage.
- **Hello?:** Copies a [random/specific] super of the opponent.
  - Based on `Nothing There`.
  - Need to decide whether this is random or specific. One-time use, probably.
- **CENSORED:** Censors your animations brielfly on use.
  - Based on `CENSORED`.
  - Covers the player with a CENSOR bar for a few seconds.
- **Lament:** Gives you a 6/4 use ranged attack with fast startup.
  - Based on `Funeral of the Dead Butterflies`.
  - (Not really a fan of this one tbh) Self-explanatory.
- **Yin:** All players take damage when too close to one another.
  - Based on `Yin`.
  - Self-explanatory. Synergizes with Yang.
- **Yang:** All players take damage when too far from one another.
  - Based on `Yang`.
  - Self-explanatory. Synergizes with Yin.
