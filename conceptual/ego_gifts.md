# OVERVIEW

The EGO Gifts mechanic is that players get to pick a buff once every while in a match, currently **at the start of most odd-numbered rounds** (second, third, fifth, seventh, etc.) These buffs would minorly change how the game is played, but introduces vareity into the matches. 

## NOTES
- Something very important to watch out is that there is no EGO gift which is an auto-pick against a certain character, or one that is busted period. Side-grade them to hell and back if that ever happens.
- KEEP MATCH DESCRIPTIONS SHORT. >8 words if possible.

## EXAMPLES

- **Illusory Hunt:** Grant air-dash.
  - Based on `All-Around Cleaner`.
  - Pretty straightforward: enables dashing in the air for a character.
  (*PG pointed out this might result in a "wait if this is so fun why not just let me airdash" from players. See how people react in playtesting. -L*)
- **Fervent Beats:** Increase damage when timed to heartbeat.
  - Based on `Heart of Aspiration`.
  - Adds a heartbeat. If you input a command within ~5 frames of the heart beat, increases damage.
- **The Thirteenth Toll:** Reduce timer by 30 seconds.
  - Based on `The Price of Silence`.
  - Reduces the time of the round by 30 seconds. *This does stack.* (**NOTE:** Not married to 30 seconds necessarily.)
- **Penitence:** Gain a powerful super move.
  - Based on `One Sin and Hundreds of Good Deeds`.
  - Uses a bonkers super, maybe at the cost of the whole super bar. (**NOTE:** This one need more fine-tuning.)
  - One time use?
- **Apostles:** Gain a follower to attack the opponent.
  - Based on `WhiteNight`.
  - Occassionaly sends one of WhiteNight's apostles to attack the enemy, probably after a successful attack lands? (But not every single attack, that would be bonkers)
- **Obsession:** [Double/1.5x] walking speed.
  - Based on `Red Shoes`.
  - Increases walking speed.
- **Melty Eyeball:** On hit, steal from the opponent's meter.
  - Based on `Blubbering Toad`.
  - Takes a tiny slice of the opponent's meter upon hitting them.
- **Punishment:** Counterhits deal extra damage and stun time.
  - Based on `Punishing Bird`.
  - Self-explanatory. Probably just a few more frames of stun and a bit more damage.
- **Hello?:** Copy an opponent's super move.
  - Based on `Nothing There`.
  - Need to decide whether this is random or specific. One-time use, probably. (*Why one time? -L*)
- **CENSORED:** Hide your animations briefly.
  - Based on `CENSORED`.
  - Covers the player with a CENSOR bar for a few seconds.
- **Well-Worn Parasol:** Block attack perfectly to negate damage.
  - Based on `Dream of a Black Swan`
  - Gives you a parry mechanic, essentially.
